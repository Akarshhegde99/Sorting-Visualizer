# 📊 Sorting Visualizer

An interactive web application that visualizes how various sorting algorithms work using animated bars. Built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, this tool helps users understand the logic and behavior of different sorting techniques in a visual and engaging way.

## 🚀 Features

- 🎯 Visualize sorting algorithms step-by-step
- 🎨 Dynamic color changes for comparisons, swaps, and sorted elements
- 🔄 Random array generation
- 🖱️ Easy-to-use interface with buttons for each algorithm
- ⚡ Smooth animations using async/await and DOM manipulation

## 🧠 How It Works

- Bars are represented as `<div>` elements with dynamic heights.
- When a sorting algorithm is selected:
  - Bars are highlighted using colors:  
    - 🔴 Red: comparing  
    - 🟢 Green: sorted  
    - 🟦 Turquoise: default
  - Swaps are animated using height exchanges with `setTimeout()` and `async/await`.
